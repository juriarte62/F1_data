# F1 Race Data analysis 
Racing like fashion, food, and music, is something that brings people of many different backgrounds together. 

This is a data science project to showcase how we can use Python to analyze Formula 1 (F1) racing data. 

## Source
The dataset will come from [Ergast](https://ergast.com/mrd/). The Ergast API is an experimental web service that provides historical F1 racing data. 

The data can be download on the website here as a CSV table or a MySQL Database Image [Download Database](https://ergast.com/mrd/db/). 

There is also a copy of the downloaded dataset in this repository called `f1db_csv`.
